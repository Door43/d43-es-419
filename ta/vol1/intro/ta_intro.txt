===== Introduction to translationAcademy =====

This module answers the question: What is translationAcademy?

==== Welcome to translationAcademy ====

The “translationAcademy” is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of Biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure.

translationAcademy contains the following sections:

  * [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:toc_intro|Introduction]] - introduces the unfoldingWord project
  * [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:toc_transvol1_2|Translation Manual]] - explains the basics of translation theory and practical translation helps
  * [[:en:ta:vol1:checking:toc_checkvol1_2|Checking Manual]] - explains the basics of checking theory and best practices
  * [[:en:ta:vol1:tech:toc_techvol1_2|Technology Manual]] - explains how to use the different technology tools
  * [[:en:ta:vol1:process:toc_processvol1_2|Process Manual]] - answer the question "what next?"

Each manual is separated into two volumes. Volume 1 of each manual covers the basics of that subject while volume 2 goes more in depth. In general, if a module is needed to translate and publish Open Bible Stories, then it is included in volume 1, if not, then it is included in volume 2.

Next we recommend you learn about:

  * [[:en:ta:vol1:intro:uw_intro|The unfoldingWord Project]]
