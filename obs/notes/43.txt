====== 43. The Church Begins ======


===== Overview: =====


The disciples waited in Jerusalem as Jesus commanded. During the feast of Pentecost, they became filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages. When a crowd of people gathered, Peter told them that this miracle was a sign that Jesus was the Messiah. When the people heard this, 3000 of them believed and were baptized. They began to meet together for teaching, prayer and fellowship.
