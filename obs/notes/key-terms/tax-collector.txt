===== Definición: =====

The job of tax collectors was to receive the money that people owed the government and to deliver it to the government.

**El trabajo de un cobrador era recoger el dinero que la gente le debía al gobierno y entregarselo al gobierno.**

   * In the time of Jesus and the apostles, the Roman government required taxes from the Jews.
  * **En el tiempo de Jesús y de los apóstoles, el gobierno romano requería que los judíos pagaran impuestos.**
  * The people who collected taxes for the Roman government would often demand more money from the people than the government required. The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.
  * **A menudo, la gente que cobraba impuestos para el gobierno romano, le demandaban a la gente más dinero de lo que el gobierno requería.**
  * The Jews considered tax collectors to be some of the worst sinners because they cheated people and because they worked for the foreign Roman government. This made the tax collectors traitors to their own people.
  * **Los judíos consideraban a los cobradores como los peores de los pecadores porque ellos engañaban a la gente y trabajaban para el gobierno romano. Esto los hacía traidores a su propia gente.**
