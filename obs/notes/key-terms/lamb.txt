**Definición**:

In the Bible, a lamb is a young sheep or goat. A sheep is a four-legged animal with a thick woolly hair. People raise them for their wool or as a source of food. Sheep are defenseless and timid. Goats are similar animals, and are used mainly for food.

**En la Biblia, un cordero es una oveja joven o una cabra joven.  Un cordero es una animal de cuatro patas con un pelo grueso lanoso.  Las personas las crian por su lana o como una fuente de alimento.  Las ovejas son indefensas y tímidas.  Las cabras son animales similares, usadas principalmente como alimento.**

   * God's people used to sacrifice sheep and lambs to Him. The ones they sacrificed had to be physically perfect, with no defects.
  * **La gente de Dios sacrificaban ovejas y corderos a Él.  Los que sacrificaban tenían que ser físicamente perfectos, sin defecto alguno.**
