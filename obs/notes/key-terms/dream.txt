Dreams are things that people see, hear, and experience in their minds while they are sleeping.

   * Most of the time, the things that people experience in dreams are not really happening, although while the person is dreaming, it seems that they are.
  * **Muchas de las veces las cosas que la gente experimenta en sueños no están pasando realmente, aunque mientras la persona está sonando parece  real**.
  * Sometimes God causes people to dream about something so they can learn from it. Sometimes God may speak directly to people in their dreams.
  * **A veces Dios provoca que la gente sueñe sobre algo para que aprenda una lección de  eso; a veces Dios puede hablarle a la gente directamente en sus sueños.**
