**Bathsheba's** husband, a man named **Uriah**, was one of **David's** best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to **go be with his wife**. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him **where the enemy was strongest** so that he would be killed.
