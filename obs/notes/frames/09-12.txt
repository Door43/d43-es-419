One day while **Moses** was **taking care of his sheep**, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the **bush did not burn up**. Moses went towards the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush, **the voice of God said**, “Moses, take **off your shoes**. You are standing on **holy ground**.”

Un día mientras Moises estaba cuidando las ovejas, vio un arbusto que estaba en llamas. Pero el arbusto no se consumía. Moises se lo acercó para verlo mejor. Al acercarse a la zarza quemando, la voz de Dios le dijo, “Moises, quítate las sandalias. Estás de pie en tierra santa.”
