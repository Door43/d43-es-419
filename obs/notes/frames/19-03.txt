**God** told **Elijah** to go to a stream **in the wilderness** to hide from Ahab who wanted to kill him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. **Ahab** and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. **The drought** was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.
