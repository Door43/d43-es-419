===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **You poisonous snakes** - This could be translated as, "You are like lying poisonous snakes!" John was calling them poisonous snakes because they were dangerous and deceptive.
  * **Every tree that does not bear good fruit** - John is not really talking about trees. This is an expression that compares good fruit to good actions and attitudes that come from God.
  * **will be cut down and thrown into the fire** - This means, "will be judged and punished by God."
  * **John fulfilled** - That is, "John was doing" what the prophet said God's messenger would do.
  * **See** - This could be translated as "Look and see" or, "Pay attention!"
  * **my messenger** - That is, "I, Yahweh, will send my messenger." In some languages it would be more natural to use an indirect quote for this sentence, such as: "what the prophet Isaiah predicted when he said that God would send his messenger."
  * **ahead of you** - In this phrase, the word "you" refers to the Messiah.
  * **prepare your way** - God's messenger will prepare the people to listen to the Messiah.
