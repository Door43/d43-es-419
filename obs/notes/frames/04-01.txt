  * **many years after the flood** - Many generations had passed since the end of the flood.
  * **again many people** - Noah's family multiplied into enough people to fill a city.
  * **same language** - This means there was only one language, so they could all understand each other.
  * **a city** - It is best to use a general word for "city" since the text does not give a specific name.
