===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Jesus continues the story.)
  * **What am I doing?** - That is, "Why am I living like this?" or, " I should not be living like this!" or, "It doesn't make sense for me to live like this." The son isn't really asking a question, so some languages will have to translate this as a statement.
