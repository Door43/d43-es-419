**Hundreds of years later**, **God** spoke to a man named **Abram**. God told him, “**Leave your country and family** and go to the land I will show you. I will **bless** you and **make you a great nation**. I will **make your name great**. I will bless those who bless you and **curse** those who curse you. **All families on earth** will be blessed because of you.”

Cientos de años después, Dios habló a un hombre llamado Abram. Dios le dijo, “Dejes a tu tierra y a tu familia y vayas a la tierra que te mostraré. Yo te bendeciré y hacerte una nación grande. Haré tu nombre grande. Bendiceré a los que te bendicen y maldiceré a los que te maldicen.
