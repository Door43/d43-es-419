{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-15-06.jpg?nolink}}

**God** had commanded the **Israelites** not to make a **peace treaty** with any of the people groups in **Canaan**. **But one of the Canaanite people groups, called the Gibeonites**, **lied to Joshua and said** they were from a place far from Canaan. They asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God **where the Gibeonites were from**. So Joshua made a peace treaty with them.
