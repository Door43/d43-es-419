Then **Gideon used the gold to make a special garment** like the **high priest** used to wear. But the people started **worshiping** it as if it were an **idol**. So **God punished Israel** again because they worshiped idols. God allowed their enemies to defeat them. They finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another **deliverer**.
