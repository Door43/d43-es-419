===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Mount of Olives** - This is the name of a hill covered with olive trees, just outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem. It can also be translated as, "Olive Tree Hill."
  * **abandon me** - That is, "desert me" or, "leave me."
  * **It is written** - That is, "It is written in God's word" or, "It is written in the scriptures" or, "One of God's prophets wrote." It is also possible to say, "What is written will happen" or, "It will be like what is written." This prophecy refers to Jesus' death and his followers running away.
  * **I will strike** - That is, "I will kill."
  * **the shepherd and all the sheep** - Do not use Jesus' name in this quote because the prophet who first wrote it would not have known the shepherd's name. Also, do not refer to the sheep being the disciples. It is best to use words that mean "shepherd" and "sheep" in your translation.
  * **will be scattered** - That is, "will go away in different directions."
