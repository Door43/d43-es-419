  * **rights as the oldest son**  - According to their custom, since Esau was the oldest son, he should have been the one to receive twice as much of their father's wealth when their father died. Jacob thought of a way to take these rights of the oldest son from Esau.
  * **derechos como el hijo mayor - De acuerdo a sus costumbres, como Esau era el hijo mayor, el deberia aver sido el que recibiera lo doble de mas de la riqueza de su padre quando su padre se murio. Jacob penso de un modo de quitar estos derechos del hijo mayor de Esau. **
