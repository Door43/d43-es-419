When they arrived in **Bethlehem**, there was **no place to stay**. The only room they could find was a **place where animals stayed**. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a **feeding trough**, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him **Jesus**.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **no place to stay** - That is, "no usual place to stay." Because Bethlehem was so crowded at that time, the usual rooms for guests were already full of people.
  * **place where animals stayed** - This was a place for sheltering animals, not a place where people lived. Translate this with a term that would normally be used for a place where animals were kept.
  * **feeding trough** - That is, "animal feed box" or, "wooden or stone box for feeding animals." The box could have been filled with hay to provide a padded surface for the baby to lie on.
