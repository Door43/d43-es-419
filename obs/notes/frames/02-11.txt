**God** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **disobeyed** me. Now the **ground is cursed**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then **you will die**, and your body will **return to dirt**.” The man named his wife **Eve**, **which means** “**life-giver**,” because she would become the **mother of all people**. And God clothed **Adam** and Eve with animal skins.

Ahora la tierra está maldita, y tú trabajarás duro para cultivar la comida. Luego tú morirás, tu cuerpo volverá a la tierra.” El hombre nombró a su esposa Eva, que quiere decir “dadora de vida,” porque ella llegará a ser la madre de toda gente. Y Dios se vistió a Adán y a Eva con los cueros de animales.</font>

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **ground is cursed**  - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.
  * **you will die**  - The ultimate punishment for their disobedience was death. Spiritual death is our separation from God. Physical death is our separation from our body.
  * **return to dirt**  - God created Adam from the dirt or soil and gave him life. As a result of sin, his life will be taken from him and his body will decompose and become dirt again.
  * **Eve, which means 'life-giver'**  - God gave life to Adam and Eve, and it is passed on to every person through childbirth.
  * **mother of all people**  - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say "she would be the grandmother of all people."
