**God** said to the man, “You listened to your wife and **disobeyed** me. Now the **ground is cursed**, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then **you will die**, and your body will **return to dirt**.” The man named his wife **Eve**, **which means** “**life-giver**,” because she would become the **mother of all people**. And God clothed **Adam** and Eve with animal skins.

  * **ground is cursed** - As punishment for Adam's disobedience, the earth would no longer be fruitful. Adam would have to work very hard to raise enough food to eat.

  * **mother of all people** - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say "she would be the grandmother of all people."
