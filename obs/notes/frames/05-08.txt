  * **Stop! Do no hurt the boy!** - God protected Isaac and kept Abraham from killing him.
  * **you fear me** - Abraham feared God, which included respect and reverence for God. Because of those things, he obeyed God.
  * **your only son** - Ishmael was also Abraham's son, but Isaac was the only son of Abraham and Sarah. God's covenant was with Isaac and it was through Isaac that God would fulfill his promise.
