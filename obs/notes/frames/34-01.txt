===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **stories** - Jesus used these stories to teach truths about God's kingdom. It is not clear if the events actually happened or not. If your language has a term that includes both fictional and real stories, you should use it here.
  * **mustard seed** - This probably refers to the seed of the black mustard plant, which has tiny seeds that rapidly grow into very large plants. If there is a word for this plant in your language, you should use it. If not, you may need to substitute the name of another plant which has the same characteristics.
  * **the smallest seed of all** - That is, "the smallest of all the seeds that people plant."
