**The jailer** woke up, and when he saw that the prison doors were open, he was terrified! He thought all the prisoners had escaped, so he planned to kill himself. (He knew the **Roman authorities** would kill him if he allowed the prisoners to escape.) But **Paul** saw him and yelled, “Stop! Do not hurt yourself. **We** are all here.”
