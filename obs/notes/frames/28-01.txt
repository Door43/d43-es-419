**One day**, a **rich young ruler came up to Jesus** and asked him, “**Good teacher**, what must I do **to have eternal life?**” Jesus said to him, “**Why do you call me 'good'**? **There is only one who is good**, **and that is God**. But if you want to have eternal life, **obey God's laws**.”

Un día, un joven rico se acercó a Jesús y le preguntó: “Maestro bueno, ¿qué he de hacer para tener la vida eterna?” Jesús le dijo: “¿Por qué me llamas” bueno ”? Sólo hay uno que es bueno, y que es Dios. Pero si usted quiere tener la vida eterna, obedece las leyes de Dios.”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **One day**  - This phrase introduces an event that happened in the past, but does not state the specific time. Many languages have a similar way to begin telling a true story
  * **Un dia - Esta frase introduce un evento que paso en el pasado**, pero** que no**  establece el tiempo **especifico. Muchos idiomas tienen una forma similar para empezar a decir una historia real.**
  * **rich young ruler**  - This man was already a rich and powerful political official, even though he was still young.
  * **came up to Jesus**  - That is, "approached Jesus."
  * **Good teacher**  - That is, "righteous teacher." He was not saying that Jesus was simply a skilled teacher.
  * **to have eternal life**  - That is, "to receive eternal life" or, "to live with God forever." Also consider how "eternal life" was translated on **[[:es-419:obs:notes:frames:27-01|[27-01]]]** and see the note about that there.
  * **Why do you call me 'good'**  - Jesus is not denying that he is God. Rather, he is asking if the ruler understands that Jesus is God.
  * **There is only one who is good, and that is God**  - Another way to say this would be, "The only one who is truly good is God" or, "God is the only one who is truly good."
