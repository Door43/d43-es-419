{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-26-06.jpg?nolink&}}

**Jesus** continued saying, “And during the time of the **prophet Elisha**, there were many people in **Israel** with skin diseases. But Elisha did not **heal** any of them. He only healed the skin disease of **Naaman**, **a commander** of Israel’s enemies.” The people who were listening to Jesus were **Jews**. So when they heard him say this, **they were furious at him**.

Jesús continuó diciendo: “Y durante el tiempo del profeta Eliseo, había mucha gente en Israel con enfermedades de la piel. Pero Eliseo no sanó a ninguna de ellas. Él sólo sanó la enfermedad de la piel de Naamán, el comandante de los enemigos de Israel.” Las personas que escuchaban a Jesús eran Judios. Así que, cuando le oyeron decir esto, se enfurecieron contra él.

  * **a commander** - That is, "a military leader."
  * **they were furious at him** - The Jews did not want to hear that God had blessed any people group besides themselves, so they were very angry at what Jesus said.
