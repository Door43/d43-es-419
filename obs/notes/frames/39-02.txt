Inside the house, the **Jewish leaders put Jesus on trial**. They brought many false **witnesses** who **lied about him**. However, **their statements did not agree with each other**, so the Jewish leaders could not prove **he was guilty of anything**. Jesus did not say anything.

Adentro de la casa, los líderes de los Judios pusieron a Jesús en juicio. Ellos trajeron a muchos testigos falsos que mintieron acerca de él. Sin embargo, sus testimonios no se acordaron, así los líderes de los Judios no podrían probar que estuviera culpable de nada. Jesús no dijo nada.

===== Translation Notes =====


    *  **put Jesus on trial** - This could be translated as, “had a formal meeting to accuse Jesus of doing something wrong.” Usually a trial is done to find out if someone is innocent or guilty of a certain crime. In this case, the leaders were determined to make Jesus seem guilty.
    * **lied about him** - That is, “told lies about him” or, “falsely accused him of doing something wrong.”
    * **their statements did not agree with each other** - This could be translated as, “they said things about Jesus that were very different from each other” or, “the witnesses said things about Jesus that contradicted each other.”
    * **he was guilty of anything** - That is, “that he had done anything wrong.”
