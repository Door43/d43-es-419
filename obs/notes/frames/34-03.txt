===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **story** - See how you translated this term in **[[:es-419:obs:notes:frames:34-01|[34-01]]]**.
  * **yeast** - This can also be translated as, "leaven" or, "the little bit of leaven." It is added to bread dough to make it rise. A little bit of yeast can be mixed into a large amount of dough and make the whole batch of dough rise.
  * **bread dough** - This is a mixture of flour and liquid that can be shaped and baked into bread. If you do not have words for dough or flour, you can borrow a word for flour or call it "ground-up grain."
  * **it spreads throughout the dough** - That is, "every part of the dough has yeast in it" or, "the yeast grows throughout all the dough."
