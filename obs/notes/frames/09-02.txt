After hundreds of years, the number of **Israelites** had become very large. The **Egyptians** no longer remembered **Joseph** and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the **Pharaoh** who was ruling Egypt at that time **made the Israelites slaves** to the Egyptians.
