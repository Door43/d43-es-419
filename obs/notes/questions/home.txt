====== Comprehension Questions ======


Translators should use these questions during the level checking process this way:


    - Translate the story.
    - Read the story to some one that speaks your language and did not help with the translation.
    - Ask them the questions on these pages.
    - Did they answer the questions correctly? Then the translation is very accurate, natural and clear.
    - Did they not answer some of the questions correctly? Then correct the translation.


The translation can be approved for level 2 when the questions have been answered correctly.
