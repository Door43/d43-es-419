====== sorcery ======

===== Definition: =====


"Sorcery" or "witchcraft" refers to using magic, which involves doing powerful things through the help of evil spirits.

  * Sorcery can involve doing good things such as healing someone, or harmful things such as putting a curse on someone. But both are wrong because they involve using an evil spirit's power.
  * The use of sorcery is a great evil in God's sight. It is considered as evil as other terrible sins, such as adultery, worshiping idols, and child sacrifice.
  * This could also be translated as, "evil spirit power" or "black magic" or "casting spells."
