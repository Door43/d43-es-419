====== lots, casting lots ======

===== Definition: =====

A "lot" is a marked object that is thrown or picked from among other similar objects as an unbiased way of making a choice or decision. The term "cast" means "throw" and the practice of casting lots was often used by people to find out what God wanted them to do.

  * Casting lots was used to choose which priest would perform a specific duty in the temple at a specific time.
  * The soldiers who crucified Jesus threw lots to decide who would keep Jesus' robe.
  * Throwing lots involved tossing or rolling small marked stones or pieces of broken pottery. The person who rolled the specially marked piece would be chosen.
  * Some cultures use a bunch of straws for drawing lots. Someone holds the straws so that no one can see how long they are. People each pick a straw and the one who picks the longest (or shortest) straw is the one who is chosen.
  * The phrase "casting lots" can be translated as "tossing lots" or "drawing lots" or "rolling lots". Make sure it does not sound like the lots were being thrown a long distance.
