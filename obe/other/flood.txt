====== flood ======

===== Definition: =====

A flood is a great amount of water that covers over land completely so that the ground cannot be seen.

  * In Noah's time, people had become so evil that God caused a worldwide flood to come over the entire surface of the earth, even covering the mountaintops. All other floods cover a much smaller land area.
  * Figurative uses of "flood" refer to a large amount of something or to circumstances that are overwhelming.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Ways to translate "flood" could include, "an overflowing of water" or "large amounts of water."
  * For the expression "like a flood of water" where water is already mentioned, the word "flood" could be translated as "an overwhelming amount" or "an overflowing."
  * The term "flood" can also be used figuratively, as in "let not the flood sweep over me" or "they surround me like a flood." If possible, this figurative language should be kept in a translation.
  * For example, "I flood my bed with tears" could be translated as "my tears soak my bed with water like a flood."
