====== Babylon, Babylonian (Babilonia) ======

===== Facts: =====

The ancient city of Babylon was the capital of the Babylonian Empire. It was located in the ancient region of Babylonia, which is now the country of Iraq.

  * Babylon was located along the Euphrates River, in the same region where the Tower of Babel had been built hundreds of years before.
  * Sometimes the word "Babylon" refers to the entire Babylonian Empire. For example, the "king of Babylon" ruled the entire empire, not just the city.
  * The Babylonians were a powerful people group who attacked the kingdom of Judah and kept them in exile in Babylonia for 70 years.
  * Part of this region was called "Chaldea" and the people living there were the "Chaldeans." Often "Chaldea" is just another name for "Babylonia."
