====== tenth, tithe ======

===== Definition: =====

The terms "tenth" or "tithe" refer to a ten percent portion of one's money, crops, livestock, or other possessions.

  * In the Old Testament, God instructed the Israelites to set aside a tenth of their belongings to give as an offering of thanksgiving to him.
  * This offering was used to support the Levite tribe of Israel who served the Israelites as priests and caretakers of the tabernacle or temple.
  * The New Testament does not require giving a tithe to God, but instead stresses giving generously and cheerfully to support the work of Christian ministry and to help the poor.
  * This could be translated as "one-tenth" or "one out of ten."
