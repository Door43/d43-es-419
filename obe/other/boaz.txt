====== Boaz ======


===== Facts: =====


Boaz was the husband of Ruth, the great grandfather of King David, and an ancestor of Jesus Christ.

    * Boaz lived during the time when there were judges in Israel (between the 14th and 11th century B.C.)
    * Boaz "redeemed" Ruth, who was the widow of one of his distant relatives. This is a picture of the redemption that Jesus performed.
