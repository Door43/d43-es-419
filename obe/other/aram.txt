====== Aram, Aramean ======

===== Definition: =====

"Aram" is the name of a region where Abraham's relatives lived. It was located in what is the modern day country of Syria.

  * The people living in Aram became known as "Arameans" and spoke the Aramaic language.
  * One of Shem's sons was named Aram. Another man named Aram was a cousin of Rebekah. It is probable that the region of Aram was named after one of these two men.
  * This region was also called "Paddan Aram" and later became known by the Greek name, "Syria."
