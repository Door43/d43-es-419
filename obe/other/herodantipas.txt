====== Herod Antipas ======

===== Facts: =====

Herod Antipas was the Roman ruler of Judea during the time of Jesus. He was sometimes referred to as "King Herod" even though he was not really a true king.

  * There are several people named "Herod" in the Bible. King Herod the Great was the father of Herod Antipas. Make sure it is clear in the translation that these two Herods were two different people.
  * Herod Antipas ruled one-fourth of the Roman Empire, and so he was also called "Herod the Tetrarch."
  * Antipas was the Herod who gave the order for John the Baptist to be killed by beheading.
  * He was also the Herod who questioned Jesus before his crucifixion.
