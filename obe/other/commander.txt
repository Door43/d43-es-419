====== commander ======

===== Definition: =====

A commander is a leader of an army who has charge of and responsibility for the soldiers.

  * The Old Testament has references to commanders of 10, 100 and thousands of troops. They commanded according to their ability.
  * When the apostle Paul was being attacked and beaten in Jerusalem, a commander had to step in and take charge of the situation to stop it.
  * When the context explicitly says that this is a commander of an army, a general term like "leader" could be used. For example, when Yahweh is called the "commander" of angel armies, this could be translated as "leader."
  * Other possible translations could include, "captain" or "officer" or "manager."
