====== footstool ======

===== Definition: =====

A footstool is an object upon which a person may raise and rest his feet while sitting.

  * In scripture, a footstool is used figuratively to refer to a place where God's authority is permanently represented, as when King David wishes to build the temple as a "place of rest for the ark..the footstool of our God."
  * A footstool also represents having power over your enemies, as when God the Father says that he will make Jesus' enemies a footstool for his feet.
