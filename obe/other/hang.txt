====== hang ======

===== Definition: =====

To hang something is to suspend something or someone above the ground.

  * Death by hanging typically is done using a rope noose that is tied around a person's neck and suspended from an elevated object, like a tree limb. Judas killed himself by hanging.
  * Jesus' death by hanging on a wooden cross was done differently: the soldiers suspended him by nailing his hands (or wrists) and his feet to the cross.
