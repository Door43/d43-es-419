====== festival ======

===== Definition: =====

In general, a festival is a celebration held by a community of people.

  * The word for "festival" in the Old Testament literally means "appointed time."
  * The festivals celebrated by the Israelites were specially appointed times or seasons that God had commanded them to observe.
  * The word "feast" is used in several English translations because the celebrations included having a large meal together.
  * There were several main festivals that the Israelites celebrated every year:
  *      * Passover
      * Festival of Unleavened Bread
      * Firstfruits
      * Festival of Weeks (Pentecost)
      * Festival of Trumpets
      * Day of Atonement
      * Festival of Shelters
  * The purpose of these festivals was to thank God and to remember the amazing things he had done to rescue, protect, and provide for his people.
