====== sister ======

===== Definition: =====

A sister is a female person who shares at least one biological parent with another person.

  *In the New Testament, "sister" is sometimes used figuratively to refer to a woman who is a fellow believer in Jesus Christ.
  * Sometimes the New Testament writers used the phrase, "brothers and sisters" to emphasize that they were talking about all believers in Christ, both men and women.
  * When they referred specifically to a "sister," they were referring to a certain woman who was a fellow believer.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological sister, unless this would give wrong meaning.
  * Other ways to translate this could include, "sister in Christ" or "spiritual sister."
