====== Asherah, Asherim ======

===== Definition: =====

Asherah was the name of a goddess that was worshiped by Canaanite people groups during Old Testament times.

  * This term and the plural form "Asherim" refer to carved wooden images or carved trees that were made to represent this goddess. Sometimes these images are referred to as "Asherah poles."
  * The Asherim were often set up near altars for the false god Baal, who was thought of as Asherah's husband.
  * God commanded the Israelites to destroy all the carved images of Asherah.
  * But some of the Israelite leaders, like King Solomon, King Manasseh, and Queen Jezebel, not only kept many of the Asherim in Israel, but also influenced the people to worship them.
  * On the other hand, other leaders like Gideon, King Asa, and King Josiah obeyed God and led the people in destroying these idols.
