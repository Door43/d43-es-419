====== incense ======


===== Definition: =====

Incense refers to a mixture of fragrant spices that, when burned, produce smoke that has a pleasing smell. These spices are made from parts of plants that are beaten into tiny pieces.

    * God told the Israelites to burn incense as an offering to him. The incense had to be made from mixing equal amounts of five specific spices exactly as God directed. This was a sacred incense, so they were not allowed to use it for any other purpose.
    * There was a special golden altar used only for burning the incense.
    * The incense was offered at least four times a day at each hour of prayer.
    * In addition, incense was burned every time a burnt meat offering was made.
    * The burning of incense represents prayer and worship rising up to God from his people.

Other ways to translate "incense" would be, "fragrant spices" or, "good-smelling plants."
