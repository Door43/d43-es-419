====== well ======

===== Definition: =====

A well is a hole in the ground that collects water either from rain or underground springs. Most wells are man made.

  * Wells were very important features of the arid Bible lands.
  * In Bible times, a well could be a deep shaft or a shallow pit. It was usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it.
  * Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If the target language has a known term for a well, that term should be used.
  * Other ways to translate this could include something like, "deep water hole" or "deep and narrow pit full of water."
