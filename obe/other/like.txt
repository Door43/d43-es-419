====== like, likeness ======

===== Definition: =====

People or things that are "like" each other have things that are similar to each other.

  * To "be like" something means to be similar to it, to share qualities that are the same.
  * People were created in God's "likeness," that is, in his "image" and have qualities or characteristics that are "like," that is, "similar to," God's.


==== Translation Suggestions ====


  * The phrase "in the likeness of his death" could be translated as, "sharing in the experience of his death" or "as if experiencing his death with him."
  * The phrase "in the likeness of sinful flesh" could be translated as, "being like a sinful human being" or "to be a human being." Make sure the translation of this phrase does not sound like Jesus was sinful.
  * The expression, "the likeness of an image of perishable man, of birds, of four-footed beasts and of creeping things." could be translated as, "idols made to look like perishable humans, or animals such as birds, beasts and crawling things."
