====== lampstand ======

===== Definition: =====

A lampstand was a special structure on which a lamp was placed in an elevated position to provide light to a room.

  * A lamp in biblical times was a clay bowl of olive oil or fat, with a spout and wick that burned with an open flame to provide light.
  * A lampstand could be constructed of wood or iron, but golden lampstands are mentioned in the book of Revelation in John's vision.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * This term could be translated as, "lamp pedestal" or "structure for holding a lamp." It would also be helpful to include a photo or drawing of a lampstand in the translated Bible.
