====== Samson ======

===== Facts: =====

Samson was one of the judges, or deliverers, of Israel. He was from the tribe of Dan.

  * God gave Samson amazing, superhuman strength which he used to fight against Israel's enemies, the Philistines.
  * Samson was put under a vow to never cut his hair and to never drink wine or any other fermented drink.
  * When he gave into the pleading of his treacherous wife, Delilah, and told her the secret of his strength, she cut his hair so that he would lose his strength.
  * While Samson was in captivity, God enabled him to regain his strength and gave him the opportunity to destroy the temple of the false god Dagon, along with many Philistines.
