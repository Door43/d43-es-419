===== Definition: =====

A shield is an object held by a soldier in battle to protect himself from flying arrows and other forms of attack by an enemy. To shield someone means to protect that person from harm.

  * Shields could be different shapes, but often were circular or oval.
  * They were made of sturdy materials such as leather, wood, or metal that could withstand piercing by a sword or arrow.
  * Using this term as a metaphor, the Bible refers to God as a protective shield for his people.
  * Paul also talks about the "shield of faith" which protects believers from spiritual attacks from Satan.
