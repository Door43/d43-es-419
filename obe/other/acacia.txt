====== acacia ======

===== Definition: =====

In ancient times, the acacia was a common shrub or tree growing in the land of Canaan; it is still plentiful there today.

  * The orange-brown wood of the acacia tree is very hard and durable, making it a useful material for building things.
  * This wood is highly resistant to decay because it is very dense so that it keeps out water, and it has natural preservatives that keep insects from destroying it.
  * In the Bible, acacia wood was used to build the tabernacle and the ark of the covenant.
  * Based on the Hebrew word for this tree, the KJV uses the terms "shittah tree" and "shittim wood," rather than acacia.
