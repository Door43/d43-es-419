====== scroll ======

===== Definition: =====

In ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long sheet of papyrus or leather. After writing on a scroll or reading it, people rolled it up using rods on the ends.

  * Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture.
  * If someone wanted a messenger to deliver a scroll to someone else, he could seal it with wax. This would prevent the messenger or anyone else from opening the scroll and writing anything in it. The person who received the scroll would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it.
