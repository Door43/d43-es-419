===== Definition: =====

A sandal is a simple shoe held onto the foot with straps around the instep or ankles; they are worn by both men and women.

  * A sandal was sometimes used to confirm a legal transaction, such as the selling of property (Ruth 4:7) by one man taking off a sandal and giving it to the other.
  * Removing one's shoes or sandals was a sign of respect and reverence, especially in God's presence.
  * John said that he was not worthy to even untie Jesus' sandals, which would have been the task of a lowly servant or slave.
