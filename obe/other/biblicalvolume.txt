How to translate units of volume in the Bible:

  - Keep the Bible term, spelling it in a way that is similar to the way it sounds or is spelled in the Bible. [See Transliterate]
  - An important reason for keeping the Bible terms is to show that the Bible is true and that people actually used these units of measure during that time period.
  - If it doesn't work to use the Bible term, then instead, state the equivalent amount using a unit of measure that is known.
  - These methods could be combined, using the Bible term, but then also giving the equivalent amount in the text or a note.
