====== twelve tribes of Israel ======

====== doce tribus de Israel ======

===== Definition: =====

The twelve tribes of Israel refer to the twelve sons of Jacob and their descendants.

  * Jacob was the grandson of Abraham, and God changed Jacob's name to Israel. Both the name "Jacob" and the name "Israel" refer to the same person.
  * These are the names of the tribes: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph and Benjamin. The descendants of Levi did not inherit any land in Canaan because they were a tribe of priests who were set apart to serve God and his people. Joseph received a double inheritance of land, which was passed on to his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh.
  * The above list is generally accepted as the list of the tribes of Israel, but there are several places in the Bible where the list is altered slightly. For example, sometimes Levi, Joseph or Dan is omitted and sometimes Josephâ€™s two sons Ephraim and Manasseh are included.
