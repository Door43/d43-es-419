====== Horeb ======

===== Definition: =====

Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai, where God gave Moses the stone tablets with the ten commandments.

  * Horeb was the place where Moses saw the burning bush when he was tending sheep.
  * It was also the place where God told Moses to strike a rock to provide water for the thirsty Israelites as they were wandering in the desert.
  * The exact location of this mountain is not known, but it may  have been in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula.
  * Some scholars have thought that "Horeb" was the actual name of the mountain and that "Mount Sinai" or "mountain of Sinai" referred to its location in the desert of Sinai.
