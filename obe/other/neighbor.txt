====== neighbor ======

===== Definition: =====

A neighbor usually refers to a person who lives nearby. It can also refer more generally to someone who lives in the same community or people group.

  * One connotation of the term "neighbor" is that this is a person that someone would normally protect and treat kindly because he is part of the same community.
  * In the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus used the term "neighbor" figuratively, expanding its meaning to include all human beings, even someone who is considered an enemy.
  * The last six of the Ten Commandments focus on loving other people, that is, loving one's neighbors.
  * If possible it is best to translate this term literally with a word or phrase that means "person who lives nearby."
