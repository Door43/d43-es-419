====== ark of the covenant ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Old Testament, the ark of the covenant was a wooden chest, overlaid with gold, that was placed inside the most holy place of the tabernacle (and later, the temple), where the high priest would meet with God on behalf of the people.

  * God told the Israelites to put certain objects in this special box to remind them of his covenant with them: the two stone tablets with the ten commandments written on them, Aaron's staff and a jar of manna.
  * When God desired to speak to Israel through Moses in the tabernacle and when Israel's high priest presented appropriate sacrifices at the temple, God's presence would appear over the ark of the covenant.
  * Revelation 11:19 describes the ark of the covenant as being in God's temple in heaven.
