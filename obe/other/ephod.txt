====== ephod ======

===== Definition: =====

An ephod was an apron-like garment worn by the Israelite priests. It fit over the shoulders and covered the lap. It was tied around the waist with a sash.

  * This priestly garment was costly and beautiful, embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and red yarn.
  * The breastpiece of the priest was attached to the front of the ephod. Behind the breastpiece were stored the Urim and Thummim, which were stones used for asking God what his will was in certain matters.
  * Gideon made an ephod out of gold and it became something that the Israelites worshiped as an idol.
