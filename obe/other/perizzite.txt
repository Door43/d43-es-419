===== Facts: =====

â€‹A people group encountered on multiple occasions by the Israelites in Palestine. The group is never mentioned with any description as to their identity or what area they inhabited.

  * They are mentioned most frequently in the book of Judges where it says that the Perizzites intermarried with the Israelites and influenced them to serve their false gods.
  * The Perizzies were a different people group from the Perezites. It may be necessary to spell the names very differently to make this clear.
