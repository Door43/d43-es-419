====== Enoch ======

===== Facts: =====

The Enoch who is mentioned several times in the Old and New Testaments was the father of Methuselah and the great-grandfather of Noah.

  * Enoch had a close relationship with God.
  * When he was 365 years old, he was taken up to be with God without dying.
  * This Enoch was descended from Seth. He was a different man from the Enoch whose father was Cain. Some languages may prefer to spell the names of these two men a little bit differently from each other to make it clear that they were two different people.
