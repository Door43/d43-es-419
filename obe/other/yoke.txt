====== yoke ======

===== Definition: =====

A "yoke" is something that is used to join two things for the purpose of working together. To "be yoked" is to be joined to something or someone.

  * A physical yoke is a piece of wood or metal attached to two or more animals to connect them to each other for the purpose of pulling a plow or a cart.
  * There are several figurative meanings for yoke:
      * It can refer to the oppression of being in slavery or undergoing persecution from a cruel ruler.
      * It can also refer figuratively to working together toward a common purpose, such as in marriage or business or in serving Jesus.
  * If possible it is best to translate this literally, using the local term for a yoke that is used for farming. Other ways to translate the figurative use of this term could be, "oppressive burden" or "heavy load."
