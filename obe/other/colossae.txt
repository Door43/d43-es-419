====== Colossae, Colossians ======

===== Facts: =====

In New Testament times, Colossae was a city located in the Roman province of Phrygia, an area of land that is now southwestern Turkey. The Colossians were the people who lived in Colossae.

  * Located about 100 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea, Colossae was situated along an important trade route between the city of Ephesus and the Euprates River.
  * While in prison in Rome, Paul wrote the book called "Colossians," which was a letter to the believers at Colossae to correct false teachings.
  * When he wrote this letter, Paul had not visited the church at Colossae but had heard about the believers there from his coworker, Epaphras.
  * Epaphras was probably the Christian worker who started the church at Colossae.
  * The book of Philemon was a letter by Paul addressed to a slave owner in Colossae.
