====== conscience ======

===== Definition: =====

The conscience is the part of a person's thinking through which God makes him aware that he is doing something sinful. God gives him an inner understanding about what is right or wrong.

  * God gave people a conscience to help them know the difference between what is right and what is wrong.
  * A person who obeys God is said to have a "pure" or "clear" or "clean" conscience.
  * If someone ignores their conscience and no longer feel guilty when he sins, the Bible calls this a "seared" or "insensitive" or "polluted" conscience.
  * This word may need to be translated with a phrase, depending on the context.
