====== reproach ======

===== Definition: =====

To reproach someone means to criticize or disapprove of that person's character or behavior. A reproach is the negative comment about the person.

  * Saying that a person is "above reproach" or "beyond reproach" or "without reproach" means that this person behaves in a God-honoring way and there is little or nothing that could be said in criticism of him.
  * The word "reproach" can also be translated as "shame" or "disgrace." Therefore, to reproach someone would be to bring shame or disgrace upon them.
