====== thresh, threshing floor ======

===== Definition: =====

Threshing is the process of separating wheat grain from the rest of the wheat plant. 

  * Plants to be threshed were first beaten (or trampled by oxen) to separate the straw from the grain and the chaff. Then the grain and chaff were tossed into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away while the grain fell back down on the threshing floor.
  * A "threshing floor" is large, solid, flat area that is set aside for that purpose. 
  * In biblical times, threshing floors were made of a large flat rock or packed down dirt, giving a hard, level surface to collect the threshed grain.
