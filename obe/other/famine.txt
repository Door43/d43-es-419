====== famine ======

===== Definition: =====

A famine is a widespread disaster that involves an extreme lack of food throughout a country or region.

  * Food crops can fail because of natural causes such as lack of rain and other poor weather conditions, crop disease, or insects
  * Food shortages can also be caused by war, or by bad government.
  * In the Bible, God often caused famine as a way to punish nations when they sinned against him.
  * In Amos 8:11 the term "famine" is used figuratively to refer to a time when God punished his people by not speaking to them. This could be translated with the word for "famine" in your language, or with a phrase such as, "extreme lack" or "severe deprivation."
