====== ox, oxen ======

===== Definition: =====

An "ox" refers to a type of cattle that is specifically trained to do agricultural work. The plural of this term is "oxen." Usually oxen are male and have been castrated.

  * Throughout the Bible, oxen are depicted as animals tied together by a yoke to pull a cart or a plow.
  * Oxen working together under a yoke was such a common occurrence in the Bible that the phrase "to be under a yoke" became a metaphor for hard work and labor.
  *  A bull is also a male type of cattle, but it has not been castrated and has not been trained as a work animal.
