====== synagogue ======


===== Definition: =====


A synagogue is a building where Jewish people assemble to worship God. Since ancient times, a synagogue's services have included times of prayer, scripture reading, and teaching about the scripture.


    * The Jews built synagogues because many of them lived far away from the temple in Jerusalem and could not go there often.
    * Jesus often taught in synagogues.
    * The word "synagogue" can also refer to the group of people meeting there.
