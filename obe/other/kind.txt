====== kind ======

===== Definition: =====

When "kind" is a noun, it refers to a group or classification of things that are connected by shared characteristics.

  * A group or classification of plants or animals that share characteristics is called a "kind".
  * The main thing that distinguishes each "kind" as a separate group is that members of that group can reproduce more of their same "kind".
  * Often there are many different variations within each "kind." For example, horses, zebras and donkeys are all members of the same "kind."
  * This term could be translated as "type" or "class" or "group" or "category."
