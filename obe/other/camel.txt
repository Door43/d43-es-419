====== camel ======

===== Definition: =====

A camel is a large, four legged animal with either one or two humps on its back.

  * In Bible times, the camel was the largest animal found in Israel and the surrounding regions.
  * The camel was used mainly for carrying people and burdens. Some people groups also used camels for food, but not the Israelites because God had said that camels were unclean and were not to be eaten.
  * Camels were valuable because they could move swiftly in the sand and could live without food and water for several weeks at a time.
