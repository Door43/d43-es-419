====== grape ======


===== Definition: =====


Grapes are a small round berry fruit that grows in clusters on vines. Their juice is used in making wine.


    * People grow grapes in gardens called vineyards. These normally consist of long rows of vines.
    * Because grapes don't last long after they have become ripe, people dry them to eat later. In English, these dried grapes are called raisins. The Old Testament refers to cakes made of raisins.
