====== courtyard ======

===== Definition: =====

A courtyard is an enclosed area that is surrounded by a building or walls. It has no roof, but rather is open to the sky.

  * The Old Testament tabernacle was surrounded by one courtyard, enclosed by walls made of thick, cloth curtains rather than stone.
  * The temple complex in Jerusalem during the time of Jesus had four major courtyards.
      * The Courtyard of Priests was just outside the temple building and could only be entered by the priests. This was where the basin for washing and the altar for sacrificing were located.
      * The next court further away from the temple building was the Courtyard of Israel which was where any Jewish man could worship and pray.
      * The Courtyard of Women was separated from these inner courts and was where Jewish women could worship. They were not permitted to go into the inner courts.
      * These inner courts were surrounded by a low stone wall that separated them from the larger, outermost court called the Courtyard of the Gentiles. This courtyard was the only place that a nonJew was permitted to be in the Temple complex.
  * The courtyard of a house was an open area in the middle of the house that could be entered through doors from the house.
  * Some English Bible versions also use the word 'court' for this term.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "courtyard" could be translated as "enclosed space" or "walled-in land" or "temple grounds" or "temple enclosure."
  * Sometimes the term "temple" may need to be translated as "temple courtyards" or "temple complex." so that it is clear that the courtyards are being referred to, not the temple building.
