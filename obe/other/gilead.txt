====== Gilead ======

===== Definition: =====

Gilead is the name of a mountainous region east of the Jordan river, where the Israelite tribes of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh lived.

    * The "hill country of Gilead" or "Mount Gilead" are ways that this region is referred to because of the hilly nature of its terrain. 
    * "Gilead" was also the name of several men in the Old Testament. One of these men was the grandson of Manasseh.
