====== Judaism, Jewish religion ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "Judaism" has been used from the time of the New Testament until the present day to refer to the religion practiced by the Jews, that is, the "Jewish religion."

  * During the time of the Old Testament, the term "Judaism" was not yet used. Rather, at that time the religion of the Jews (or Israelites) was referred to as the "Jewish religion."
  * The Jewish religion (Judaism) includes all the Old Testament laws and instructions that God gave to the Israelites to obey. It also includes the customs and traditions that have been added to the Jewish religion over time.
  * When translating, the term "Jewish religion" or "religion of the Jews" can be used in both the Old and New Testaments. The term "Judaism" should only be used in the New Testament since that term did not exist before that.
