====== bread ======


===== Definition: =====

Bread is a food made from flour mixed with water and oil. It is usually made with something that makes it rise, such as yeast. It is then shaped into a loaf and baked.

  * Bread can also be made without something to make it rise.
  * Bread was the main food in biblical times, and is still a basic food in many cultures.
  * Because bread was the main food, the word "bread" was sometimes used to refer to food in general, as in Luke 4:4. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
