In addition to its primary meaning, "water" also often refers to a body of water, such as an ocean, sea, lake, or river.

  * The term "waters" refers to bodies of water or many sources of water. It can also be a general reference for a large amount of water.
  * To "water" livestock and other animals means to "provide water for" them. In Bible times, this involved drawing water up out of a well and pouring it into troughs for the animals to drink from.
  * In the Old Testament, God is referred to as the "spring of living water" for his people. This means he is the source of spiritual power and refreshment. "Living water" was a reference to naturally flowing water, as in a stream or spring. 
  * In the New Testament, Jesus used the phrase "streams of living water" to refer to the Holy Spirit working in a person to transform and bring new life.

  * The phrase, "draw water" could be translated as, "pull water up from a well with a bucket."
  * "Streams of living water will flow from them" could be translated as, "the power and blessings from the Holy Spirit will flow out of them them like streams of water." Instead of "blessings" the term "gifts" or "fruits" or godly character" could be used.
