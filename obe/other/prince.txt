====== prince ======

===== Definition: =====

A prince is the son of a king. However, this word is often a general reference to a leader, ruler or other powerful person.

  * Jesus is called the Prince of Peace and the Prince of Life.
  * In Acts 2:36, Jesus is referred to "Lord and Christ" and in Acts 5:31 he is referred to as "Prince and Savior"; this indicates that in this context "Prince" is a synonym for "Lord."
  * In Scripture, "prince" can refer to Satan or some other evil spiritual being, such as the prince of Persia who resisted the archangel Michael in bringing God's message to Daniel.
  * Some possible ways to translate this term would be, "ruler, leader, chieftain, official or captain."
