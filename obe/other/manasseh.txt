====== Manasseh ======

===== Facts: =====

There were two men by the name of Manasseh in the Old Testament:

  * One of these men was the firstborn son of Joseph. His descendants formed the half-tribe of Manasseh.
      * Although Manasseh was the oldest son, God led his grandfather Jacob to not give him the special blessing that is usually given to the firstborn. Instead that blessing went to his younger brother Ephraim.
      * Jacob adopted Manasseh and Ephraim as his own sons, giving their descendants the same status as the other tribes of Israel.
  * Another man named Manasseh was one of the kings of Judah.
      * King Manasseh was an evil king who sacrificed his own children as burnt offerings to false gods.
      * God punished him by allowing him to be captured by an enemy army. Manasseh repented and turned back to God. He destroyed the altars where idols were worshiped.
