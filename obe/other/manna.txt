====== manna ======

===== Definition: =====

Manna was a thin, bread-like food that God provided the Israelites in the wilderness after they left Egypt.

  * Manna came in the form of white flakes which appeared each morning on the ground under the dew. The Israelites gathered it every day except on the Sabbath and there was just enough for everyone to be fed.
  * On the day before the Sabbath, God told the Israelites to gather twice the amount so they wouldn't have to gather any the following day.
  * The word "manna" means "what is it?"
