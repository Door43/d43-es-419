====== eagle ======

===== Definition: =====

An eagle is a large, powerful bird of prey which is often used as a symbol for freedom and power.

  * The Bible compares the speed and strength of an army to how fast and suddenly an eagle swoops down to catch its prey, or how quickly it soars into the sky to a great height.
  * Isaiah states that those who trust in the Lord will soar as an eagle does. This is a metaphor used to describe the freedom and strength that comes from trusting and obeying God
