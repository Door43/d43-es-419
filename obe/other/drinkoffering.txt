====== drink offering ======

===== Definition: =====

A drink offering was a sacrifice to God that involved pouring wine on an altar. It was often offered together with a burnt offering and a grain offering.

  * Jesus' death on the cross was the ultimate drink offering, as his blood was poured out on the cross for our sins.
