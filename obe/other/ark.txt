====== ark ======

===== Definition: =====

In general, an ark refers to a rectangular wooden box that is made to hold or protect something. An ark can be large or small in size, depending on what it is being used for.

  * In the Bible, the English word "ark" is specifically used to refer to either the "ark of the covenant" or the boat that Noah built to escape the worldwide flood.
  * The Hebrew word that is used to refer to Noah's ark is the same word used for the basket or box that held baby Moses when his mother put him in the Nile River to hide him. In the phrase "ark of the covenant", a different Hebrew word is used for "ark".
  * Depending on the context, "ark" can be translated as "box", "chest" or "very large boat".
