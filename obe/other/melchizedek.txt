====== Melchizedek ======

â€‹

===== Facts: =====

During the time when Abram lived, Melchizedek was the king of Salem (later called Jerusalem). He was also called a "priest of God Most High."

  * Melchizedek's name means, "king of righteousness."
  * After Abram's victory over an alliance of powerful kings, Melchizedek blessed Abram and served him bread and wine.
  * Then Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of the plunder from his victory.
  * In the New Testament, Jesus is called a priest in the "order of Melchizedek." This may refer to the fact that Jesus is not like the Israelite priests who received their priesthood because they were descended from Levi. Rather, he is our Great High Priest whose priesthood comes directly from God, not from human descent.
