====== family ======

===== Definition: =====

The biblical family was a community of persons related by marriage or kinship including what today is called "extended" family.

  * The Hebrew family was a religious community passing on traditions through worship and instruction.
  * Usually the father was the major authority of the family.
  * Family could also include servants, concubines, even foreigners.
  * Some languages may have a broader word such as "clan" or "household" that would fit better in contexts where more than just parents and children are being referred to.
