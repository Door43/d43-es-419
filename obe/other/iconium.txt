====== Iconium ======

===== Facts: =====

Iconium was a city in south central Asia Minor (now the country of Turkey).

  * Iconium was located where the modern day city of Konya is now located.
  * When Paul and Barnabas were expelled by the Jews from the region of Antioch after their successful ministry to the Gentiles in Antioch on the first missionary journey, they went to Iconium.
  * The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles in Iconium were planning to stone Paul and his coworkers, but they escaped to the nearby city of Lystra. Then the people from Iconium and Antioch came to Lystra and also stirred up the people there to stone Paul.
