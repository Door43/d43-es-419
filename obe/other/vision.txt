====== vision ======


===== Facts: =====

When a person has a vision, it means he has seen something that is not from our physical world. In the Bible, a vision is something unusual that God shows someone supernaturally.

    * Visions are seen while the person is awake. They are different from dreams, which happen when a person is asleep.
    * God sends visions to tell people something that is very important. For example, Peter was shown a vision to tell him that God wanted him to welcome Gentiles.
    * The phrase "saw a vision" could be translated as, "saw something unusual from God."
