====== new moon ======

===== Definition: =====

A "new moon" is the first or beginning phase of the moon as it travels in its orbit around the planet Earth. The moon appears completely dark or has a small, crescent-shaped sliver of light on its edge.

  * In the Bible, it is most likely that the term "new moon" referred to when just a tiny sliver of the moon's light was showing, not when it was completely dark.
  * The new moon was used to mark the beginnings of certain time periods.
  * The Israelites celebrated a new moon festival that was signified by the blowing of a ram's horn.
  * Several times in the Bible this time is referred to as the "beginning of the month."
