===== Facts: =====

Abimelech was a Philistine king in the region of Gerar during the time when Abraham and Isaac were in the land of Canaan..

  * Abraham deceived King Abimelech by telling him that Sarah was his sister rather than his wife.
  * Abimelech took Sarah into his household, but returned her immediately when God appeared to him in a dream and rebuked him.
  * Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement regarding disputed ownership of wells at Beersheba.
  * Many years later, Abraham's son Isaac and his family settled in the region ruled by Abimelech.
  * Another man by the name of Abimelech was a son of Gideon and a brother of Jotham. Some translations may use a slightly different spelling of his name to make it clear that he is a different person from King Abimelech.
