====== tradition ======

===== Definition: =====

Tradition refers to customs and practices that have been kept over time and which are passed down to people in later generations.

  * Many of the traditions that were practiced by the Jews were not required by Old Testament laws, but were added by religious leaders over time.
  * Some verses have "traditions of men" or "human traditions" which makes it clear that this refers only to the Jewish practices that were added, not God's laws.
  * Sometimes "tradition" is used in a more general way that includes the laws that God had required as well as the manmade religious traditions.
  * Today, many traditions that Christian churches practice are not mandated by scripture, but are a result of historically accepted customs and practices.
