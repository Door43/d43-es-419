====== command, to command, commandment ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "command" refers to telling or ordering someone to do something.

  * God commands us to obey his teachings. That includes commanding all people to repent and follow Jesus.
  * Sometimes a command tells people what they should do, such as "Honor your parents."
  * Other times a command tells people what they should not do, such as, "Do not steal."
  * The term "commandment" is very similar in meaning, but it usually refers to something God has decreed, and it is more formal and permanent than an everyday command.
