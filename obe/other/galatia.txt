  * The apostle Paul wrote a letter to the Christians who lived in the province of Galatia. This letter is the New Testament book called Galatians.
  * The Gentile Christians in Galatia were being influenced by the Jewish Christians there to keep some of the Jewish laws.
  * One reason that Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians was to emphasize again the gospel of salvation by grace, not by works.
