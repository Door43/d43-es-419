====== Ur ======

===== Facts: =====

Ur was an important city along the Euphrates River in the ancient region of Chaldea, which was located in the area of what is now the modern-day country of Iraq.

  * Abraham was from the city of Ur and it was from there that God called him to leave to go to the land of Canaan.
  * Haran, the brother of Abraham and father of Lot, died in Ur. This most likely influenced Lot to go with Abraham when he left Ur.
