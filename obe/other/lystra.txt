====== Lystra ======

===== Facts: =====

Lystra is the name of a city in ancient Asia Minor which Paul visited on one of his missionary journeys. It was located in the region of Lycaonia which is now in the modern-day country of Turkey.

  * On this trip to Lystra, Paul met Timothy, who became a fellow evangelist and church planter.
  * After Paul healed a crippled man, the people in Lystra tried to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods, but were stopped by the apostles' firm rebuke and refusal of their worship.
