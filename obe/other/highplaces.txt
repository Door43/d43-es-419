====== high places ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "high places" refers to places on the tops of hills or mountains where idol worship altars and shrines were built and used.

  * Many of the kings of Israel sinned against God by building altars to false gods on these high places. This led the people to become deeply involved in worshiping idols.
  * When a God-fearing king took office in Israel, often he would remove the high places and abolish idol worship.
  * However, some of these good kings were careless and did not remove the high places, which resulted in the entire nation of Israel continuing to worship idols.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Other ways to translate this term could include, "elevated places for idol worship" or "hilltop idol shrines" or "idol altar mounds."
