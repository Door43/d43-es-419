====== image, carved figure ======

===== Definition: =====

An image is something that is like something else, in appearance or in essence. A "carved image" is another name for an idol.

  * A carved image (or "graven image") is a metal or wooden object that has been made to look like an animal, person, or thing, for the purpose of worshiping a false god.
  * Sometimes in the Bible the carved idol is referred to with just the word "image."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, the term "image" could also be translated as "statue" or "engraved idol" or "carved religious object."
  * It may be more clear in some languages to always use the term "carved image," even in places in the text where only the term "image" is used.
