====== staff ======

===== Definition: =====

A staff is a long wooden stick or rod that was often used as a walking stick.

  * When Jacob was old, he used a staff to help him walk.
  * God turned Moses' staff into a snake to show his power to Pharaoh.
  * Shepherds also used a staff to help guide their sheep, or to rescue the sheep when they fell or wandered. The staff had a hook on the end, which was different from the shepherd's rod, which was straight and was used to club wild animals trying to attack the sheep.
