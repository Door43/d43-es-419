====== Baal (Baal)======

===== Facts: =====

Baal was the name of a false god that was worshiped by several people groups in the land of Canaan.

  * The name "Baal" means "lord." The worship of Baal was therefore a direct challenge to the authority of Yahweh, who alone is the true Lord.
  * The worship of Baal included acts of prostitution and sometimes involved burning children as a sacrifice.
  * At different times, the Israelites sinned by also worshiping Baal.
  * There were 450 prophets of Baal in the northern kingdom of Israel, during the reign of King Ahab. The prophet Elijah set up a test for the prophets of Baal and proved that their god does not exist. As a result, the people killed the prophets of Baal and turned back to worshiping Yahweh, the only true God.
