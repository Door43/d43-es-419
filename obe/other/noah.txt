====== Noah (NoÃ©) ======

===== Facts: =====

Noah was a man who lived over 4,000 years ago, at the time when God sent a worldwide flood to destroy all the evil people in the world. God told Noah to build a gigantic boat in which he and his family could live while the flood waters covered the earth.

  * Noah was a righteous man who obeyed God in everything.
  * When God told Noah how to build the gigantic boat, Noah built it exactly the way God told him to.
  * Inside the boat, Noah and his family were kept safe and later their children and grandchildren filled the earth with people again.
  * Everyone born since the flood is a descendant of Noah's family.
