====== Holy Place, Most Holy Place ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the terms "Holy Place" and "Most Holy Place" refer to the two parts of the building of the tabernacle complex and later on, of the temple complex.


  * These rooms were called "holy" because they were where God came to meet with his people the Israelites.
  * It was only the high priests who were permitted to enter these rooms as representatives of the people.
  * The Holy place was the first room and it contained two things: the altar of incense and the table with the consecrated bread on it.
  * The Most Holy Place contained the ark of the covenant.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "Holy Place" could also be translated as, "Room Set Apart for God" or "Special Room for Meeting God" or "Place Reserved for God."
  * The term, "Most Holy Place" could be translated as, "Room that is the Most Set Apart for God" or "Most Special Place for Meeting God."
