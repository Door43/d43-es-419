====== test ======

===== Definition: =====

A test refers to difficult circumstances God allows in a person's life. To "put something to a test" can also be used to mean, "to challenge something or someone for proof."

  * God sometimes uses tests to expose people's sin.
  * God also sometimes uses tests to demonstrate that people trust him.
  * God often uses Satan as the agent of testing in the Bible.
  * Unlike God, Satan does not simply test people, but instead he tempts them to sin.
  * People do not have the right to "put God to a test" because he is always faithful and holy.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This can also be translated as "challenge."
