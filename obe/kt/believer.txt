====== believer (creyente) ======

===== Definition: =====

A "believer" is a person who trusts completely in a person or an idea.

  * In the Bible, "believer" specifically refers to someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior.
  * The term "Christian" eventually came to be the main title for believers because it indicates that they believe in Christ and obey his teachings.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term could be translated by a word or phrase that means, "one who trusts in Jesus" or "someone who knows Jesus and lives for him."
  * Other ways to translate "believer" could be, "follower of Jesus" or, "people who know and obey Jesus."
  * The term "believer" is a general term for any believer in Christ, while "disciple" and "apostle" were used more specifically for people who knew Jesus while he was alive. It is best to translate these terms in different ways, in order to keep them distinct.
