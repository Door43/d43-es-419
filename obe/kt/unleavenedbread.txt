====== unleavened bread ======

===== Definition: =====

Bread that is unleavened has been baked without yeast, or any other leavening substance.

  * In the Old Testament, unleavened bread became most well-known from the time when God told the Israelites to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. From that time on, unleavened bread has been used in their yearly Passover celebrations as they remember how they had to escape from Egypt in haste.
  * The apostle Paul figuratively used the term "unleavened bread" to urge fellow believers to live in a way that is sincere and truthful toward others.
  * Just as leavened bread represents the presence of sin and a past way of life, so unleavened bread represents the removal of sin and living in a way that honors God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Other ways to translate this term could include, "bread with no yeast" or "flat bread that did not rise."
  * Make sure the translation of this term is consistent with how you translate the term "leaven."
