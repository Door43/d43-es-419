====== firstborn ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "firstborn" refers to the offspring of people or of animals that is born first, before the other offspring are born.

  * In the Bible, "firstborn" usually refers to a male offspring.
  * In Bible times, the firstborn son was given a place of prominence and twice as much of his family inheritance as the other sons.
  * Often it was the firstborn male of an animal that was sacrificed to God.
  * This concept can also be used figuratively. For example, the nation of Israel is called God's firstborn son because God gave it special privileges over other nations.
  * Jesus, the Son of God is called God's firstborn because of his importance and authority over everyone else.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When "firstborn" occurs in the text alone, it could also be translated as "firstborn male" or "firstborn son," since that is what is implied. (See: [[:es-419:ta:figuresofspeech:      ]])
  * Other ways to translate this term could include,  "the son who was born first" or "the eldest son" or "the number one son."
  * When used figuratively to refer to Jesus, this could be translated with a word or phrase that means, "the son who has authority over everything" or "the Son who is first in honor."
  * Caution: Make sure the translation of this term in reference to Jesus does not imply being created.
