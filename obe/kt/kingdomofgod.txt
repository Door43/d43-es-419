====== kingdom of God, kingdom of heaven (reino de Dios, reino de los cielos) ======

===== Definition: =====

Both of these terms refer to God's rule and authority over his people and over all creation. They also refer to the people who are ruled by God.

  * In the New Testament, the book by Matthew uses the expression "kingdom of heaven" to refer to the "kingdom of God." Both terms mean the same thing.
  * The Old Testament prophets said that God would establish his kingdom by sending the Messiah to rule with righteousness and to conquer his enemies.
  * Jesus, the Son of God, is the Messiah who will rule over God's kingdom.
  * The spiritual kingdom of God has always existed in heaven because God has always reigned there.
  * The physical kingdom of God will be established on earth when Jesus returns from heaven to rule as the Messiah forever.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, "kingdom of God" can be translated as "God's rule (as king)" or "when God reigns as king" or "God's realm of authority."
  * The term "kingdom of heaven" should retain the word "heaven" since this is the term that Matthew used and is distinctive to his gospel. It could be translated as "God's rule from heaven as king" or "God in heaven reigning" or "heaven's reign" or "heaven's realm of authority."
  * Some translations may prefer to capitalize "Heaven" to show that it refers to God. Others may include a note in the text such as "kingdom of Heaven (that is, God)."
  * A footnote at the bottom of the page of a printed Bible may be used to explain the meaning of "heaven" in this expression.
