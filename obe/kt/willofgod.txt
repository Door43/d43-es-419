====== will of God ======

===== Definition: =====

The "will of God" refers to God's desires and plans.

  *  God's will especially  relates to his interactions with people and how he wants people to respond to him.
  * It also refers to his plans or desires for the rest of his creation.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In Romans 12:2, Paul talks about "[God's] good, perfect and pleasing will." Make sure that the translation of this does not make it sound like God has more than one kind of will. One way to translate this would be, "[God's] will, which is good, perfect and pleasing."
  * The "will of God" could also be translated as, "what God desires" or "what God has planned" or "God's purpose."
