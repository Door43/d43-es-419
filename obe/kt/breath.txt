====== breathe ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible the term "breathed" is used figuratively to refer to giving life or having life.

  * The Bible teaches that God "breathed into" Adam the breath of life. It was at that point that Adam became a living soul.
  * In the time of the great flood, the Bible says that every creature that "breathed" was drowned in the water.
  * Jesus breathed on the disciples and said "Receive the Spirit". This probably refers to literally breathing out air onto them.
  * Sometimes the term "breathing" or "breathing out" can refer to speaking.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * The phrase "breathed his last" is a figurative way of saying "he died." It could also be translated as, "he took his last breath" or "he stopped breathing and died."
  * Describing the Scriptures as "God-breathed" means that God spoke or inspired the words of the Scriptures that human authors wrote down. It could be translated as, "inspired by God" or "authored by God" or "spoken by God." It could be also be said that "God breathed out the words of Scripture."
  * It is probably best if possible to translate "God-breathed" somewhat literally since it is difficult to communicate the exact meaning of this.
