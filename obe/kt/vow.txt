====== vow ======

===== Definition: =====

A vow is a promise that a person makes to God. The person promises to do a certain thing in order to specially honor God or to show devotion to him.

  * A vow may be given to express devotion and love to God without asking for anything from him in return.
  * A person may make a vow in order to ask God for his special protection, provision, or presence in exchange for making the vow.
  * God is not required to fulfill a request that a person asks for in his vow.
  * After a person makes a vow, he is obligated to fulfill that vow.
  * Failure to keep a vow makes the person who made the vow subject to God's judgment.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, “vow” could be translated as “solemn promise” or “promise made to God.”
  * This word should be translated differently than "oath."
