====== love (amor) ======

===== Definition: =====

To love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. God is love and is the source of true love.

  * There are different meanings for "love" which some languages may express using several different words, depending on the context. 
  * The main type of love is God's love, which is unselfish, sacrificial, and focused on the good of others. The same word can be used to describe when people love God and and when they love other people in this unselfish way.
  * Jesus demonstrated this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.
  * When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that are selfless and that cause the other person to thrive. This especially includes forgiving others.
  * Another word in the New Testament refers to "brotherly love" or "love for a friend or family member." This is natural human love between friends or relatives.
  * This word is also used in such contexts as, "they love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Some languages may have a special word for the unselfish kind of love that God has for people and that he helps people have for others. Ways to translate this might include, "adore" or "care for unselfishly" or "love from God." Make sure that the word used to translate God's love can include the characteristics of being unselfish, self-sacrificing, and unconditional.
  * Sometimes the English word "love" describes the affection that people have for friends and family members. Some languages may have a different word for this such as "like very much" or "care for" or "have strong affection for."
  * In contexts where "love" is used to express a strong preference for a thing, food, or activity, this could be translated by "strongly prefer" or "like very much" or "greatly desire."
  * Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.
  * Many languages have to express "love" as an action. So for example, they would translate "Love is patient, love is kind…" as "When a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him…"
