====== unclean, uncleanness ======

===== Definition: =====

In the Bible, the term "unclean" is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch, to eat, or to sacrifice. There are both literal and figurative meanings for this term.

  * In the Old Testament God gave the Israelites many instructions about which animals were "clean" and which ones were "unclean." The unclean animals could not be used for eating or for sacrifice.
  * Certain physical conditions, such as a skin disease, made a person unclean until they were healed.
  * If the Israelites touched something "unclean," they themselves would be considered unclean for a certain period of time.
  * Obeying God's commands about not touching or eating unclean things kept the Israelites holy and set apart for God's service.
  * This physical and ritual uncleanness was also symbolic of moral uncleanness.
  * In another figurative sense, an "unclean spirit" refers to an evil spirit, that is, a demon.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "unclean" could also be translated as "not clean" or "unfit in God's eyes."
  * When referring to a demon as an unclean spirit, "unclean" could be translated as "evil."
  * Make sure the translation of this term does not only mean that something is physically dirty or diseased. Rather it should be understood that this word can also refer to moral impurity or to something that God declared as unfit or unsuitable for touching, for eating, or for sacrifice.
