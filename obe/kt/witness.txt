====== witness, eyewitness (testigo, testigo ocular) ======

===== Definition: =====

A witness is someone who has seen or heard something happen. Sometimes the term "eyewitness" is used to emphasize that the person actually saw what happened.

  * During a trial, witnesses tell what they have seen or heard. What the witnesses say helps the judge to decide if the person being accused is guilty or innocent.
  * Witnesses are expected to tell the truth about what they have seen or heard.
  * To witness something means to see it happen.
  * A witness who does not tell the truth about what happened is called a "false witness."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "witness" or "eyewitness" could be translated with a word or phrase that means, "person-seeing-it" or "the one who saw it happen" or "those who saw and heard (those things)."
  * The phrase "you will be my witnesses" could also be translated as, "you will tell other people about me" or "you will teach people the truth that I taught you" or "you will tell people what you have seen me do and heard me teach."
