====== saints ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "saints" literally means "holy ones" and refers to believers in Jesus.

  * Later in church history, a person known for his good works was given the title "saint," but that is not the way this term was used in the New Testament.
  * Believers in Jesus are saints or holy ones, not because of what they have done, but rather through faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. He is the one who makes them holy.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Ways to translate "saints" could include"holy ones" or "holy people" or "holy believers in Jesus" or "set apart ones."
