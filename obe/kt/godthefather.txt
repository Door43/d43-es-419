====== God the Father, Heavenly Father (Dios el Padre, Padre Celestial) ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "God the Father" is one way of referring to Yahweh, the one true God.

  * God exists as God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son. Each one is fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that mere humans cannot fully understand.
  * The title, "God the Father," expresses the kind of personal relationship that he has with "God the Son." It is not a physical relationship. Rather, it expresses that the Son honors and serves the Father.
  * God the Father sent God the Son (Jesus) into the world and he sends the Holy Spirit to his people.
  * Anyone who believes in God the Son becomes a child of God the Father and God the Holy Spirit  comes to live in that person. This is another mystery that human beings cannot fully understand.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate "Father" with the same word that the language naturally uses to refer to a human father.
  * The term "Heavenly Father" could be translated by "Father God who lives in Heaven" or "God our Father from Heaven" or "Father who lives in Heaven."
