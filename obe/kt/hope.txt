====== hope ======

===== Definition: =====

In modern English, to hope is to desire that something for the future without complete certainty that it will happen. By contrast, hope is only used in the Bible to refer to a sure expectation that something will happen.

  * In the Bible, however, "hope" often refers to trusting in God, expecting him to protect us and provide for us. There is an assurance that what is hoped for will happen.
  * The ultimate hope is being assured of our salvation through our faith in Christ. Peter calls this our "living hope."


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "Hope" could also be translated as "to expect" or "to trust" or "to be assured of."
  * The phrase, "nothing to hope for" could be translated as "nothing to trust in" or "no expectation of anything good."
  * To "have hope" means to "believe that something good will happen" or to "know that God will do the good things he has promised." To have no hope means to have no assurance that anything good will happen."
  * The phrase "Christ Jesus our hope" could be translated by, "Christ Jesus whom we are expecting (to save us)" or "Christ Jesus who we are confident will save us."
  * "A living hope" could be translated by, "a sure expectation of being saved" or "God's sure promise that we will live with him forever."
