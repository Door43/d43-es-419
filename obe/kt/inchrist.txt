====== in Christ, in Jesus, in the Lord ======

===== Definition: =====

The phrase "in Christ" and related terms refer to the state of being in relationship with Jesus Christ through faith in him.

  * These terms can refer to a believer "being in relationship with" Christ, "belonging to" Christ, "being in fellowship with Christ," or "depending on Christ."
  * Related terms include, "in Christ Jesus, in Jesus Christ, in the Lord Jesus, in the Lord Jesus Christ."
  * Note that the phrases "believe in Christ" and "have faith in Christ" use "in" differently than the condition of being "in Christ".


===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, different ways to translate "in Christ" and "in the Lord" (etc) could include:
    * "who belong to Christ"
    * "because you believe in Christ"
    * "because Christ has saved us"
    * "in service to the Lord"
    * "relying on the Lord"
    * "because of what the Lord has done."
  * People who "believe in" Christ or who "have faith in" Christ believe what Jesus taught and are trusting him to save them because of his sacrifice on the cross that paid the penalty for their sins.
