====== redeem, redemption ======

===== Definition: =====

To redeem something is to buy back something that was previously owned or that was held captive. Redemption is the act of redeeming.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "redeem" could also be translated as "to buy back" or "to pay to free someone (from sin)."
