====== fruit ======


===== Definition: =====


Fruit is the edible food produced by a plant. In the Bible, fruit is sometimes used figuratively to refer to a person's works. 

    * The fruit or works of a person reflect his inward spiritual condition. Just as a good plant produces good fruit, a good spiritual condition produces good works.
    * The Bible lists the fruit that God's Spirit produces in the lives of those who obey him: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness and self control.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Note that the word "fruit" in English can also be plural, referring to more than one fruit. So the "fruit of the Spirit" could also be "fruits of the Spirit."
  * It is best to use the general word for "fruit" that is commonly used in the local language area to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree.
