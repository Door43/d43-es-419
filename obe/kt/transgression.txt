====== transgress, transgression ======

===== Definition: =====

A transgression is a disobedient act that breaks a command, rule, or moral code. To transgress means to deliberately turn away from something God has called you to do.

  * Metaphorically, transgression can be referred to as "crossing a line," that is, going beyond a limit that has been set for the good of the person and others.
  * The Bible talks about "transgression" (rebellion), "sin" (acts of wrongdoing) and "iniquity" (wickedness). They all include the meaning of acting against God's will and violating his commands.
 

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * "Trangress" could be translated as "sin" or "disobey" or "rebel against."
  * If a verse or passage uses two terms that mean "sin" or "transgress" or "trespass," it is important, if possible, to use different ways to translate these terms. Often two or more terms with similar meanings are used in order to emphasize what is being said or to show its importance.  (See:Â [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism|parallelism]])â€‹
