====== beloved ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "beloved" is an expression of affection that describes someone who is loved and dear to someone else. It literally means "loved (one)" or "(who is) loved."

  * God refers to Jesus as his "beloved Son."
  * In their letters to Christian churches, the apostles frequently address their fellow believers as "beloved."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * This term could also be translated as "loved" or "loved one" or "well-loved" or "very dear."
  * In the context of talking about a close friend, this could be translated as "my dear friend" or "my close friend." In English it is natural to say, "my dear friend, Paul" or "Paul, who is my dear friend." Other languages may find it more natural to order this in a different way.
  * Note that the word "beloved" comes from the word for God's love, which is unconditional, unselfish, and sacrificial.
