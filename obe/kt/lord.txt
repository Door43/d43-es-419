The term "lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people.

  * This word is sometimes translated as "master" when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.
  * Some English versions translate this as "sir" in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.
  * This term is also used to refer to God, especially in the phrases, "the Lord," "Lord God," and "Lord Jesus." This communicates that God is the ruler and authority over all people and all creation.

  * When it refers to Jesus, it could be translated as "master" if the context shows it means "religious teacher."
  * If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, "lord" could be translated as "sir." This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.
  * When it refers to God, a term such as "Lord" should be used. Some languages would use "Master" or some other word that communicates ownership or supreme ruler.
