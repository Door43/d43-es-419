====== clothe, clothed ======

===== Definition: =====

When used figuratively in the Bible, "clothed with" means to be endowed or equipped with something. To "clothe" oneself with something means to seek to have a certain character quality.

  * To be "clothed with power from on high" means to have power given to you.
  * In the same way that clothing is external to your body and is visible to all, when you are "clothed" with a certain character quality (like kindness), others can readily see it.
  * This term is also used to express negative experiences, such as "clothed with shame" or "clothed with terror"

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If possible it is best to keep the literal figure of speech, "clothe yourselves with" or "put on"
  * If that does not give the correct meaning, other ways to translate "clothed with" could be "showing" or "manifesting," "filled with," or "having the quality of".
  * The term "clothe" could also be translated as "cover" or "behave in a way that shows."
