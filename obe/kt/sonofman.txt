====== Son of Man ======

===== Definition: =====

The title, "Son of Man" is best known for how Jesus used it to refer to himself. There are different ways this term is used in the Bible.

  * In the Old Testament, the phrase, "son of man" is often used to mean "man" or "human being."
  * God used "son of man" as a form of address, as when he said to the prophet Ezekiel, "â€¦you, son of man, must prophesyâ€¦"
  * Jesus often used this term to refer to himself instead of saying "I" or "me." Some have said that during that time period, it was a modest way of referring to oneself.
  * The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a "son of man" coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah. Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds. Many years after that, the apostle John saw a vision of a "son of man" sitting on the clouds. These references to coming on the clouds reveal that the Son of Man is also God.
  * The title "Son of Man" also emphasizes Jesus' humanity, which shows that he is both fully God and fully human.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When Jesus uses it, this term can be translated as, "the One who became a human being" or "the Man from heaven" or "the one who came from heaven."
  * Some translators occasionally include "I" or "me" with this title (as in, "I, the Son of Man") to make it clear that Jesus is talking about himself.
  * Check to make sure the translation of this term does not give a wrong meaning (such as referring to an illegitimate son or giving the wrong impression that Jesus was only a human being).
