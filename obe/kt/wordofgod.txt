The term "word of God" is a general term that refers to anything that God has communicated to people. This includes spoken and written messages.

  * The term "scriptures" refers to the written message that God told people to write.
  * Many years after God's words were written down, people can still read these scriptures and know God's teachings.
  * In the New Testament, Jesus is called "the Word" and "the Word of God." These titles mean that Jesus fully reveals who God is, because he is God himself.

  * Depending on the context, other ways to translate this term could include, "the message of Yahweh" or "God's message" or "the teachings from God."
  * It may be more natural in some languages to make this term plural and say "God's words" or "the words of Yahweh."
  * The expression "the word of God (or Yahweh) came" is often used to introduce something that God told his prophet or his people. This could be translated as, "Yahweh spoke these words" or "God spoke this message."
  * The term "scripture" or "scriptures" could be translated as "the writings" or "the written message from God." This term should be translated differently from the translation of the term "word."
