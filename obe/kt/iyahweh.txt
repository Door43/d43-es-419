====== I, Yahweh; me, Yahweh ======

===== Definition: =====

Many times in Bible prophesy, God uses his name to speak about himself. For example, instead of saying, "Honor me" as we would expect, he says, "Honor Yahweh." 

When it is clear that Yahweh is speaking in a passage, the ULB often translates this as "Honor me, Yahweh." By adding the word "me" the ULB indicates to the reader that God is the speaker. However, "me" is not in the original text.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

There are three ways that you can translate these phrases:

  * "I" or "me"
  * "Yahweh"
  * "I, Yahweh" or "me, Yahweh"

Choose the form that will make it clear to your readers that Yahweh is the speaker.
