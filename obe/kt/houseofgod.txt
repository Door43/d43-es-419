====== house of God, Yahweh's house ======


===== Definition: =====


In the Bible, the phrase "house of God" (or "God's house") refers generally to a place where God is worshiped.

  * This term is also used more specifically to refer to the tabernacle or the temple.
  * Sometimes "God's house" is used to refer to the people of God.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * When referring to a place of worship, this term could be translated as, "a house for worshiping God" or "a place for worshiping God."
  * If it is referring to the temple or tabernacle, this could be translated as, "the temple (or tabernacle) where God is worshiped (or "where God is present" or "where God meets with his people.")
  * The word "house" may be important to use in the translation in order to communicate that God "dwells" there, that is, his spirit is in that place to meet with his people and to be worshiped by them.
  * It is best to not use the word for a church since this term in the Bible does not refer to a building or a place.
