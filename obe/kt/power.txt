====== power (poder) ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "power" refers to the ability to do things or make things happen, often using great strength and authority.

  * The "power of God" refers to God's ability to do things that are not possible for people to do.
  * God is the highest authority, and has complete power over everything that he has created.
  * God gives his people power to do what he wants, so that when they heal people or do other miracles, they do this by the power of God.
  * Because Jesus and the Holy Spirit are also God, they have this same power.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, the term "power" could also be translated as "ability" or "strength" or "energy" or "ability to do miracles" or "control."
  * An expression like "save us from the power of our enemies" could be translated as "save us from being oppressed by our enemies" or "rescue us from being controlled by our enemies." In this case, "power" has the meaning of using one's strength to control and oppress others.
