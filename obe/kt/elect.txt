====== chosen one, chosen people, Chosen One, the elect ======

===== Definition: =====

The term, "the elect" literally means "chosen ones" or "chosen people" and refers to those whom God has appointed or selected to be his people. "Chosen One" or "Chosen One of God" is a title that refers to Jesus, who is the chosen Messiah.

  * God chose people to be holy, to be set apart by him for the purpose of bearing good spiritual fruit.
  * The term "chosen one" is sometimes used in the Bible to refer to certain people such as Moses and King David whom God had appointed as leaders over his people. It is also used to refer to the nation of Israel as God's chosen people.
  * The phrase "the elect" is an older term that literally means "the chosen (ones)" or "the chosen (people)."
  * In older English Bible versions, the term "elect" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to translate the word for "chosen one(s)." More recent versions use "elect" only in the New Testament, to refer to people who have been saved by God through faith in Jesus. Elsewhere in the Bible text, they translate this word more literally as "the chosen ones."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "elect" or "chosen ones/people" could also be translated as "people whom God chose" or "the ones God appointed to be his people."
  * If possible, it is best to translate this term literally as "chosen ones" or "chosen people."
  * In reference to Jesus, "Chosen One" could also be translated as, "God's chosen One" or "God's specially appointed Messiah" or "the One God appointed (to save people)."
