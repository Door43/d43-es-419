====== last day, last days, latter days ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "last days" or "latter days" refers generally to the time period leading up to the time when Jesus will return.

  * This time period will be an unknown length of time.
  * During this time there will be an increase in evil and disasters happening on earth.
  * The "last day" is the same time period as the "day of the Lord," which is a time of resurrection and  of judgment. Jesus promised his followers that he would raise them to life "on the last day."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The "last days" can also be translated as "final days" or "end times" or "at the end of time."
  * If possible, it is best to translate this term in a different way than the translation for judgment day.
