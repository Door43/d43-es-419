====== darkness ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "darkness" literally means an absence of light. There are also several figurative meanings of this term:

  * As a metaphor, "darkness" means "impurity" or "evil" or "spiritual blindness." It is the opposite of light.
  * Satan's dominion is called the kingdom of darkness.
  * Darkness refers to anything related to sin and moral corruption.
  * People who do not know God are said to be living in darkness, which means they do not understand or practice righteousness.
  * God is light (righteousness) and the darkness (evil) cannot overcome that light.
  * The place of punishment for those who reject God is sometimes referred to as "outer darkness."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * It is best to translate this term literally, with a word in the target language that refers to the darkness of a room with no light or to the time of day when there is no light.
  * For the figurative uses, it is also important to keep the image of darkness in contrast to light as a way to describe evil and deception in contrast to goodness and truth.
  * Some translations may prefer to use a phrase to explain this idea. One way to translate this could be, "...evil, like a dark place."
