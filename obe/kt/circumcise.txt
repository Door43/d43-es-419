===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * If the culture of the target language performs circumcisions on males, the word used to refer to this should be used for this term.
  * Other ways to translate this term would be, "cut around" or "cut in a circle" or "cut off the foreskin."
  * In cultures where circumcision is not known, it may be necessary to explain it in a footnote or glossary.
  * Make sure the term used to translate this does not refer to females. It may be necessary to translate this with a word or phrase that includes the meaning of "male."
