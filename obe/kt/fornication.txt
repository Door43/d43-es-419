====== fornication, sexual immorality ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "fornication" refers to sexual activity that takes place outside the marriage relationship between a man and a woman. This is immoral and against God's plan.  Another general term for this is, "sexual immorality."

  * This term can refer to any kind of immoral sexual activity, including homosexual acts and pornography.
  * One type of fornication is adultery, which is sexual activity specifically between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse.
  * Another type of fornication is prostitution, which involves being paid for having sex with someone.
  * This term is also used figuratively to refer to Israel's unfaithfulness to God when they worshiped false gods.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Fornication or sexual immorality could be translated as "immorality" as long as the correct meaning of the term is understood.
  * This term should be translated in a different way from the term "adultery."
  * The translation of this term's figurative use should retain the literal term if possible since there is a common comparison in the Bible between unfaithfulness to God and unfaithfulness in the sexual relationship.
